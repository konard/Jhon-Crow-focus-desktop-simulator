Card Scale Inheritance\nWhen a card is drawn from a deck, it now inherits the deck's scale. If you scale up the deck (make it bigger), cards drawn from it will also be bigger.\n\n**Code change in `drawCardFromDeck()`:**\n```javascript\n// Apply the same scale as the deck to the card\ncard.scale.copy(deckObject.scale);\n\n// Adjust position offset based on deck scale\nconst scaledOffsetX = offsetX * deckObject.scale.x;\ncard.position.x = deckPos.x + scaledOffsetX;\n```\n\n### 2. Back Side Editing in Card Edit Mode\nAdded a complete \"Back Side\" section in the card interaction modal with:\n\n- **Back Title** - Input field to set text displayed on card back\n- **Show title on back** - Checkbox to toggle back title visibility  \n- **Custom Back Image** - Upload button to set a custom image as the card back\n- **Clear button** - Remove custom back image (reverts to default diamond pattern)\n\nThe UI is now organized into clear \"Front Side\" and \"Back Side\" sections for better usability.\n\n### 3. Custom Back Image Support\n- Cards can now have custom back images (uploaded as data URL)\n- Images are properly saved/loaded with application state\n- If custom image fails to load, falls back to default pattern\n- Title overlay is rendered on top of custom images with semi-transparent background for readability\n\nAll changes have been committed and pushed. Ready for review!
