The problem was **camera movement direction is inverse to viewport appearance**.\n\n### Critical Discovery\n\nBy analyzing the existing WASD controls in the codebase, I found:\n- **KeyA** (left): `panOffsetX -= speed`\n- **KeyD** (right): `panOffsetX += speed`\n\nThis reveals the key insight:\n- When `panOffsetX` **increases** (camera moves +X/right), the scene appears to shift **LEFT**\n- When `panOffsetX` **decreases** (camera moves -X/left), the scene appears to shift **RIGHT**\n\n**This is an inverse relationship!**\n\n### The Fix\n\nChanged the shift calculation from:\n```js\nconst shiftX = bookCornerX - intersectionX;  // WRONG\n```\n\nTo:\n```js\nconst shiftX = intersectionX - bookCornerX;  // CORRECT (inverted)\n```\n\nApplied to all four corner shortcuts (Q, E, Z, C).\n\n### Why Previous Attempts Failed\n\n1. **Commit 6562cce**: Swapped left/right book corner calculations, but the book corners were already correct\n2. **Commit 868aabb**: Reverted the corner swap, thinking the first fix was wrong\n3. Both attempts modified the wrong part of the code - the issue was in the **camera shift direction**, not the book corner positions\n\n### What Changed\n\nThe book corner positions remain correct:\n- Left corners: `bookWorldPos.x - bookHalfWidth` (negative X) ✅\n- Right corners: `bookWorldPos.x + bookHalfWidth` (positive X) ✅\n\nBut now the camera shift calculation is inverted for the X-axis to account for the inverse movement relationship.\n\n### Testing\n\n✅ All CI checks passing\n⏳ Ready for your testing - please verify the shortcuts now work correctly:\n- Q → top-left corner\n- E → top-right corner\n- Z → bottom-left corner\n- C → bottom-right corner\n\n### Case Study Updated\n\nThe comprehensive case study in `docs/case-studies/issue-111/README.md` has been updated with detailed analysis of this bug, including the WASD control analysis that revealed the true root cause.","created_at":"2026-01-06T17:09:56Z","html_url":"https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/focus-desktop-simulator/pull/112#issuecomment-3715549823","id":3715549823,"issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/focus-desktop-simulator/issues/112","node_id":"IC_kwDOQwmvSs7ddsp_","performed_via_github_app":null,"reactions":{"+1":0,"-1":0,"confused":0,"eyes":0,"heart":0,"hooray":0,"laugh":0,"rocket":0,"total_count":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/focus-desktop-simulator/issues/comments/3715549823/reactions"},"updated_at":"2026-01-06T17:09:56Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jhon-Crow/focus-desktop-simulator/issues/comments/3715549823","user":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1431904?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/konard","id":1431904,"login":"konard","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzE5MDQ=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/konard","user_view_type":"public"}},{"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"🤖 **AI Work Session Started**\n\nStarting automated work session at 2026-01-06T17:03:18.605Z\n\nThe PR has been converted to draft mode while work is in progress.\n\n_This comment marks the beginning of an AI work session.
