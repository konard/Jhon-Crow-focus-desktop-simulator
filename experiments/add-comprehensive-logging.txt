Comprehensive Logging Additions for renderer.js
================================================

Based on the Task agent analysis, I need to add logging to the following locations:

1. OBJECT DRAGGING (onMouseUp - line ~11047)
   - Add log when object is dropped
   - Include final position, whether stacked, etc.

2. OBJECT ROTATION (onMouseWheel - line ~11549)
   - Add log when object is rotated
   - Include rotation amount and final rotation

3. OBJECT SCALING (onMouseWheel - line ~11516)
   - Add log when object is scaled
   - Include scale delta and final scale

4. DRAWING ACTIONS:
   - enterPenDrawingMode (line ~6925) - mode entered
   - addDrawingPoint (line ~7345) - drawing points added
   - endDrawingStroke (line ~7423) - stroke completed
   - exitPenDrawingMode (line ~6980) - mode exited

5. MODE TRANSITIONS:
   - enterExamineMode (line ~14034)
   - exitExamineMode (line ~14080)
   - enterBookReadingMode (line ~18468)
   - exitBookReadingMode (line ~18529)
   - enterPlayerMode (line ~18673)
   - exitPlayerMode (line ~18758)
   - Pointer lock (onPointerLockChange - line ~10135)

Let me systematically add these logs...
